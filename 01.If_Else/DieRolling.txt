Write a Python program that simulates rolling two dice. Based on the sum of the dice rolls, 
the program will perform specific actions using nested if-else statements to handle different 
ranges of the sum (2-12).

for even sum print -> One joke 
for odd sum print -> you've got it.
special cases : 
for sum ==4 : print -> You've got the best
for sum ==8 : print -> You are just lucky.
for sum 12 :print -> You've arrived.
